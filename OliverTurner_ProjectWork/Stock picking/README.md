# Stock picking algo
We decided the whole of the S&P500 was too large a sample size for our optimisation algorithm. So we have created a set of minimum criteria for stocks to include in our portfolio.
 - Market Cap: >$20 Billion
 - Price to Earnings ratio (PE): <20
 - Price to book ratio (PB) > 1
 - Dividend  > 2.5%
