Project 3: Portfolio management

# Dashboard Demo
[Dashboard Demo Video]("Dashboard Demo.mp4")

# 1 Outline Brief

The project task is to formulate and evaluate a detailed strategy for the following scenario associated with
a group syndicate to play in a lottery. Two and a half years ago, at the start of your degree, you as a
group made an agreement to buy a lottery ticket every week and if you win a substantial amount of money,
you would invest most of it as a group so that your wealth grows further over the following 5 to 10 year
period. Last week your group won a lottery and you decided to collectively invest 10M GBP of the 12.5M
prize money. Using this 10M GBP, you would like to create and then successfully manage a stock portfolio
yourselves with the aim of having a good return in about ten years’ time. Before committing the money
to form a portfolio, you (as trained mathematicians with good knowledge of finance) decided to first do
a detailed study of possibilities on the market and create and test a prototype of your future portfolio
management system.

# 2 Task

To create and test the prototype, you decided to use data available at the yahoo finance web-site^1. You are
aiming at (i) a recipe to pick stocks such that your portfolio is likely to be profitable for some period of time
and is to carry low risk of loss of your initial investment^2 and at (ii) an algorithm for regular adjustments
of the portfolio reflecting changes on the market. These two tasks are related. Note that these tasks are
typical for Asset Management firms (and there are many students’ competitions in this area).
In your first prototype you may assume, e.g., that there is no transaction costs in adjusting your portfolio
but your final prototype could be more sophisticated.
To have confidence in the prototype before using real money, you need to test it on real data from, e.g.,
yahoo finance, by using a part of data for calibration of your prototype and the other part – for testing (i.e.
doing so-called back testing). You start with back testing and then you can do some real-time test runs of
your system as well. An ideal prototype would take data automatically from yahoo and have an interface
which is easy to use.
In creating the prototype, you will be using your knowledge of financial markets, including understanding
of stock behaviour and knowledge of ideas from financial engineering; statistical analysis, including time series
analysis; optimisation; computational skills. For analysis of financial data and for creating the prototype
itself, you may use any software and its choice should be driven by demands of tasks you will be dealing
with and also by the expertise available within the group.
It is expected that the group will not know much about available types of stocks as well as of theories
related to portfolio management. An important first task is to search for and comprehend the corresponding
information using various bibliographic sources. To help you, some initial references are provided at the end
of this description but there are a lot of other sources (books, research papers, Web-sites, videos on youtube
and so on).

# 3 Deliverables

The task deliverables should illustrate the group competence in financial modelling, facilitation of informative
quantitative decision making, in using statistical and mathematical tools at the level expected of a recent
mathematics graduate as well as identify further development.

(^1) It is permitted to use any other data source which is freely available and which could help in creating the system.
(^2) As a group, you might decide to risk a part or all of your initial investment in order to aim for a higher return. Then you
may adjust the task accordingly.



The Group should provide(i)a substantial but concise technical report on your solution to the task.(ii)
A working piece of software (if you wish so, it could be implemented in different computer languages/packages
but should have some automatic/semi-automatic connectivity) which is an implementation of your algorithms
for portfolio selection and adjustment according to changes on the market. The software should be accompa-
nied by a one-page users’ guide as an Appendix to a substantial project report. The user guide should specify
all the details (e.g. all packages needed to run the software, version of the programming environment used,
etc.) allowing the assessors to test the software. (iii) An oral presentation. The report is expected to be a
maximum of 25 pages of text (i.e., not counting appendices or table of contents, it should be single-spaced
in 12pt font). The oral presentation is maximum of 15 minutes.
You are required to provide an oral report supported by a Powerpoint presentation of your project
outcomes during the Workshop Session, Friday 15th March 2024 from 9am, and prepared to answer questions.
